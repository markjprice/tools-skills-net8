## Code editors and the solutions

Visual Studio, Rider, and VS Code + C# Dev Kit can use the same code solution files and projects for each chapter, found here: [/code](/code). 

> **Warning!** If you use multiple code editors to open these solutions, be aware that the build process can conflict. This is because Visual Studio has its own non-standard build server that is different from the standard build server used by .NET SDK CLI. My recommendation is to only have a solution open in one code editor at any time. You should also clean the solutions between opening in different code editors. For example, after closing the solution in one code editor, I delete the `bin` and `obj` folders before then opening in a different code editor.
